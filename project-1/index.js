/*
Challenge: Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project. Check the Google slide for 
what you're trying to build.

We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px

Challenge: 

Part 2: 
- Add a `header` element with a nested `nav` element. Inside the `nav`,
  include a `img` element with the image of the React logo inside
  (src="./react-logo.png") and make sure to set the width to something more manageable so it doesn't take up the whole screen
- Add an `h1` with some text describing the page. (E.g. "Reasons
  I'm excited to learn React"). Place it above the ordered list.
- Add a `footer` after the list that says: 
    "© 20xx <last name here> development. All rights reserved."
